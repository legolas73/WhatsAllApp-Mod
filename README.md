# modified WhatsAllApp-Mod

This is a more moded version of [WhatsAllApp](https://github.com/LoranKloeze/WhatsAllApp/) and moded by [#@R! ()M B@TR@ (ohari5336)](https://ohari5336.in)
I changed only some little things in bundle.js

What's New in This WhatsAllApp-Mod Version:
*   added green background at selected contact whose online now

# How to do?

After you installed this chrome extension, start web.whatsapp.com and login at your account...

1. Select the telephone numbers to be monitored in the overlay under "Lists" and carry out the search.
2. Open the devTools and show the console

# Some hints

Sometimes it seems necessary to update the list (search again). It may also be necessary to turn the phone back on in WhatsApp, otherwise the monitoring will stop. 

# combine with this nice script

For me, I additional running in the console this little script of [WhatsappTracker](https://github.com/electronixxx/WhatsappTracker) to track a single contact.
Maybe future version could implement this script...
